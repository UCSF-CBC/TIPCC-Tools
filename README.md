# TIPCC scripts and configuration 

This repository holds scripts and settings for the TIPCC cluster.  It is maintained by the [UCSF Computation Biology Core](http://cbc.ucsf.edu) group.

## Computation Biology Core (CBC) toolkit
To get access to the CBC toolkit, all of CBC's shared software installations and more, just add
```bash
source /home/shared/cbc/bashrc
```
to the end of your `~/.bashrc` file on your TIPCC account.  Next time you log in, you should be able to type
```
cbc -h
```
on the command line and you'll see all the things that have been made available for you.
