whatis("Description: bzip2 is a free and open-source file compression program that uses the Burrowsâ€“Wheeler algorithm. It only compresses single files and is not a file archiver. It typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the best available techniques (the PPM family of statistical compressors), whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six times faster at decompression. Example: `bzip2 --help` and `bzcat file.txt.bz2`.")
