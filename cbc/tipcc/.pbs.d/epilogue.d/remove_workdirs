## PBS prologue and epilogue scripts are run with almost no environment variables
## are set. They are called with arguments that helps up identify the most important
## settings (that we would otherwise get from environment variables).
##
## Furthermore, environment variables exported in these scripts are _not_ exported
## to the job environment.
##
## These script can be called explicitly at job submission, e.g.
## qsub -l prologue=~/.pbs.d/prologue.d/foo.sh epilogue=~/.pbs.d/epilogue.d/bar.sh
